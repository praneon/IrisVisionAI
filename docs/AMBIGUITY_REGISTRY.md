Purpose:
To enumerate recurring, observer-independent ambiguity patterns identified
during pilot observation of NIR iris images.

## A01 — Partial Eyelash Occlusion
Description:
Eyelashes partially obscure the superior iris region without full occlusion.

Observed in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1003R01.jpg
- S1011L01.jpg

---

## A02 — Reflection Overlapping Pupil Boundary
Description:
Specular reflections intersect or touch the pupil boundary, obscuring edge clarity.

Observed in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1012R01.jpg
- S1018R01.jpg

---

## A03 — Low-Contrast Iris–Sclera Boundary
Description:
Limbus appears weak due to illumination gradients or peripheral texture fade.

Observed in:
- S1005L01.jpg
- S1008L01.jpg
- S1014L01.jpg

---

## A04 — Discontinuous or Faint Collarette
Description:
Collarette visibility varies by quadrant and lacks continuous definition.

Observed in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1007L01.jpg
- S1016L01.jpg

---

## A05 — Texture vs Structural Feature Ambiguity
Description:
Texture patterns resemble crypts or furrows without clear structural boundaries.

Observed in:
- S1013L01.jpg
- S1017R01.jpg

---

## A06 — Shadow-Induced False Boundary
Description:
Shadows mimic structural boundaries near iris periphery.

Observed in:
- S1005L01.jpg
- S1014L01.jpg

---

## A07 — Softened Pupil Edge Due to Illumination
Description:
Pupil edge appears blurred due to illumination gradients.

Observed in:
- S1010R01.jpg
- S1018R01.jpg

---

## A08 — Peripheral Iris Texture Fade
Description:
Outer iris texture fades gradually toward the limbus.

Observed in:
- S1020L01.jpg
- S1016L01.jpg
