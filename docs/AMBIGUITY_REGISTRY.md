# Ambiguity Registry (v0.4, Frozen)

This registry lists recurring ambiguity patterns seen during pilot review.
It is a reference index, not a rulebook.

This file intentionally does not define:
- annotation instructions
- model thresholds
- clinical interpretation

## A01 — Partial Eyelash Occlusion
Eyelashes cover part of the upper iris without fully hiding it.

Seen in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1003R01.jpg
- S1011L01.jpg

## A02 — Reflection Crossing the Pupil Boundary
Specular reflection overlaps the pupil edge and reduces boundary clarity.

Seen in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1012R01.jpg
- S1018R01.jpg

## A03 — Weak Iris–Sclera Boundary
Limbus contrast is low due to lighting gradient or texture fade.

Seen in:
- S1005L01.jpg
- S1008L01.jpg
- S1014L01.jpg

## A04 — Faint or Broken Collarette
Collarette appears only in parts of the iris and lacks continuity.

Seen in:
- S1001L01.jpg
- S1007L01.jpg
- S1016L01.jpg

## A05 — Texture vs Structure Confusion
Texture can look like crypts/furrows without reliable structural edges.

Seen in:
- S1013L01.jpg
- S1017R01.jpg

## A06 — Shadow-Induced False Boundary
Shadows create ring-like edges that can be mistaken for anatomy.

Seen in:
- S1005L01.jpg
- S1014L01.jpg

## A07 — Soft Pupil Edge from Illumination
Pupil boundary appears blurred by lighting falloff.

Seen in:
- S1010R01.jpg
- S1018R01.jpg

## A08 — Peripheral Texture Fade
Outer iris texture fades gradually near limbus.

Seen in:
- S1020L01.jpg
- S1016L01.jpg

## Status

- Ambiguity space considered saturated for v0.4 pilot
- No new recurring class added after freeze
- Registry remains locked for v0.4
